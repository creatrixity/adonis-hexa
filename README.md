# Adonis Hexa

Adonis Hexa is a software development paradigm for maintaining a scalable application architecture. Writing code is fun. _Writing code is easy_, writing code that will not muck up the codebase and is reusable&mdash;not so much.

With Adonis Hexa, we attempt to solve these problems. We abstract all code into three layers:

- **Data**
- **Domains**
- **Services**
- **Foundation**
